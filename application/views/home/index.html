				<p>Hello, my name is Alex Lovo. I enjoy web development in my spare time; especially - <em>PHP</em> and <em>Javascript</em>. I have a good understanding of CSS(3), HTML(5)and databases like MySQLi and PDO. I started this website, to not only show my skillset as a web developer, but as an alternative resource for others to look at aticles in a different interface from how the original authors wrote them. These articles are NOT mine. They are articles that have assisted and shaped my understanding of web development throughout my self-taught journey. I hope that some of you find them useful as I did. I have modified some of them according to the needs of the page, <em>BUT</em> I have provided the authors name and the original links where you can find them if you want to read the original posts.</p>
				<p>If you are one of these authors that I have used your articles in my webpage, thank you for providing information for many individuals such as myself that simply don&#39;t have the time and money to go to school to attain these skills. With that being said, if you don&#39;t feel comfortable with me using your articles for any reason, please contact me at <a href="mailto:">bert08287@gmail.com</a> and I will comply with your request.</p>
				<p>I have also provided my knowledge on languages and skills in a mini resume of what I have learned over 5+ years of researching and putting to practice these skills.</p>
				<p>I will add more to my webpage when time is alloted. I have a full time job and have two children who I love to spend time with. If you have any questions for me or what I do, or maybe even help you with a project - or possibly hire me - please feel free to contact me!</p>
